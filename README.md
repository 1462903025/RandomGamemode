# RandomGamemode
 EXILED plugin for SCP:SL that has a configurable chance (10% by default) of activating a special gamemode when the round starts. Below is the current list of gamemodes.
 
# Current Gamemodes:
- <u>Dodgeball:</u> Players spawn as either Class D, Scientist, or Guard, are given unlimited SCP-018s, and are teleported to below SCP-106's chamber for an arena-style battle.
- <u>Peanut Raid:</u> All players spawn as SCP-173 besides 1 randomly chosen player, who spawns as a mini Class D and has to try to escape without being killed.
- <u>Night of the Living Nerd:</u> All players spawn as Class D besides 1 randomly chosen player, who spawns as a Scientist with an LMG and 1000 clips of ammo. The facility lights are turned off for the entirety of the round and all players are given flashlights to help navigate. The Class Ds have to escape the facility, respawn as Chaos, and kill the Scientist before being killed themselves.
- <u>SCP-682 Containment:</u> Based off of some of the endings of SCP:Containment Breach. All players spawn as NTF Commander besides 1 randomly chosen player, who spawns as a huge SCP-939 with 5000 HP. All players spawn topside as the nuke goes off. NTF has to kill the SCP before being killed themselves.

# Notes:
- See your EXILED config for options to enable/disable specific gamemodes. (Make sure you run the server at least once with the plugin so the configs generate.)
