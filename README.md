# RandomGamemode
 EXILED plugin for SCP:SL that has a 10% chance of activating a special gamemode when the round starts. Below is the current list of gamemodes.
 
## Current Gamemodes:
<ul>
	<li><u>Dodgeball:</u> Players spawn as their normal classes but are given unlimited SCP-018s and an NTF Commander keycard to easily find other players. I might eventually make it so all players spawn in one area to make it more of an arena battle.</li>
	<li><u>Peanut Raid:</u> All players spawn as SCP-173 besides 1 randomly chosen player, who spawns as a mini Class D and has to try to escape without being killed.</li>
	<li><u>Night of the Living Nerd:</u> All players spawn as Class D besides 1 randomly chosen player, who spawns as a Scientist with an LMG and 1000 clips of ammo. The facility lights are turned off for the entirety of the round and all players are given flashlights to help navigate. The Class Ds have to escape the facility, respawn as Chaos, and kill the Scientist before being killed themselves.</li>
	<li><u>SCP-682 Containment:</u> Based off of some of the endings of SCP:Containment Breach. All players spawn as NTF Commander besides 1 randomly chosen player, who spawns as a huge SCP-939 with 5000 HP. All players spawn topside as the nuke goes off. NTF has to kill the SCP before being killed themselves.</li>
</ul>

## Notes:
<ul>
	<li>If you have friendly fire enabled on your server, I don't recommend using this plugin as it will override your settings and disable friendly fire after every round.</li>
	<li>You might notice I left one gamemode out of the list as there are 5 referenced in the code. This gamemode isn't in the list because it's part of an inside joke and requires a specific player to be on the server.</li>
</ul>
